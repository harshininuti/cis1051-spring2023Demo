# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
A map of the landmarks in the US.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive US map that will draw monuments and cities. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

First, the user will input a landmark or city. The program will then find the coordinates of the city and draw the according landmark/city. We will use the file reading feature to input a U.S. map and then turtle will be used to draw the landmarks. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Laina Bockus and Caitie Conover

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

-inputting the map of the country
- getting turtle to work, drawing monuments


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- make sure all the coordinates work correctly
- the user can input any landmark that they desire not just from a list that is made available by us

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- the user can also make a map of a list of places they've been or want to go to
- 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Next steps: meeting with group members and establishing regular meeting times, delegating tasks to each members, working on our parts, and meeting with each other regularly to make sure that our progress is aligning with our goals.We
will need to research about different US landmarks and the coordinates that coorelate with them. All of us will be working on the different drawings for the monuments and figuring out the coordinates for the cities and landmarks.
